# Study of attributes shared by Major League Baseball All-Stars.

The dataset for this study is from the Sean Lahman Baseball Database.  From their website, "The database contains complete batting and pitching statistics from 1871 to 2016, plus fielding statistics, standings, team stats, managerial records, post-season data, and more."  The study uses numpy and pandas extensively, as well as matplotlib to show visuals.  The aim of the study is to explore characteristics of ballplayers and answer the question: "Are there qualities that give a player the best chance to be successful and make a career out of baseball?"
