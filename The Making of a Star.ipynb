    "In today's world, parents will stop at nothing to give their children the best chance for success.  Searching for the best schools, taking on endless extracurricular activities, and micromanaging the smallest details of their kids' lives is not uncommon for the modern day super moms and super dads.  In the sports world, the same applies.  With the rise in ultra-competitive travel sports and early specialization, parents will look for any advantage they can afford their little ones.  \n",

    "What if there was a blueprint to follow that gave young boys the best chance to achieve their dreams and graduate from local recreational league all-star to a Major League Baseball All-Star?  Zealous parents would undoubtedly follow it verbatim.\n",

    "The beauty of baseball is that players come in all different shapes, sizes, backgrounds, and schooling levels.  It's a heavily skill-based sport where most players cannot rely solely on their naturally given athleticism but must sharpen and refine their hitting and pitching mechanics to ascend.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, that's not to say the highest level baseball players do not share some of the same attributes. The purpose of this study is to explore many of those attributes and answer this question: \"Are there qualities that give a player the best chance to be successful and make a career out of baseball?\"  Success in the game can take many forms: from MVPs to World Series titles to enshrinement in Cooperstown at the Hall of Fame.  To remove the team aspect and get a true sense of what it means to reach the pinnacle of a successful baseball career, two measurable parameters will the used: yearly salary and All-Star game appearances. These were chosen because high salaries suggest longevity and consistent success, and an All-Star game appearance speaks to a player being at the top of their profession for the position they play."

    "Grouping the Dataframe by pitchers (True) and hitters (False), the first real observation to make is the difference in mean yearly salary.  Per the data, MLB All-Star position players averaged earning a little over $350,000 more yearly than pitchers.  A possible explanation is the longevity of a batter is expected to be longer than a pitcher because of pitchers' injury risks.  Shoulder and elbow injuries to labrums and ligaments can force pitchers to miss extended periods or full seasons more frequently than hitters, thus decreasing their value to clubs when contracts are up or even preventing pitchers from getting to their next big deal."

    "With batters' salaries especially intriguing, it is important to group batters by right handed, left handed, or switch to see if there is any advantage to batting orientation.  Left handed batters look to be the big winners at the bank, scoring over \\$250,000 more than right handers and over \\$630,000 more than switch hitters per year.  This seems a little curious, as switch hitters are the most rare and one wouldn't expect left handers to have that great of an edge over them in career earnings.  One hypothesis is most left handed hitters are also left handed throwers, and left handed throwers are forced into playing either first base or an outfield position.  These positions are historically the most offensive minded positions on the field, and their offensive production leads to bigger paydays.     "

    "To further explore the idea that left handed throwers have some relation to left handed batters, the players were grouped by how they throw.  Not surprisingly, left handed throwing non-pitchers garnered the highest average yearly salary.  A little shocking is the margin, though.  Lefties received $875,000 more yearly than their counterpart right handed throwing position players.  Again, lefthanded throwers are almost exclusively first basemen and outfielders as position players.  Their assumed power hitting at these spots should help explain their inflated pay.   "

    "For the next portion of the analysis, we look at college attendence for MLB All-Stars.  Both NCAA and junior college teams are counted in the data, and the main focus here is to determine if there is a more direct path to MLB stardom by skipping higher education to enter professional baseball out of high school.  The initial look shows 44.6% of All-Star pitchers and 38.5% of All-Star hitters attended college.  These statistics are surprisingly low.  Many top amateur baseball players show promise in high school and are eligible to be drafted and signed following their senior year, but still it would be shortsighted if we didn't take a closer look at why these numbers are so low.

    "Though the NCAA championship for baseball originated in 1947, the amateur game did not gain popularity until closer to the 1980s.  With the rise in hype surrounding the now-televised College World Series and increased financial support from university athletic departments to baseball programs, modern day college baseball is in a much different place than it was half a century ago.  Therefore in order to get a better grasp of whether college baseball is a viable route for a budding prospect, it is necessary to take a more recent look at MLB All-Stars and their education decisions.

    "The updated statistic of 61.3% of pitchers and 52.5% of hitters playing college baseball shows just how the game has grown at the amateur level in recent years.  With programs improving and high level athletes choosing to pursue an education while playing, the college game has seemingly become more competitive and a better place than before for players to hone their skills for the next level.  The roughly 9% difference between the positional groups still raises some questions but could be explained by scouts better identifying top level hitting prospects earlier and getting them signed to professional contracts.  Meanwhile pitchers could use the extra time as an amateur in college to prepare their skillset for the challenges of the professional level."

Also, the percentages of the total US population for each state were calculated and uploaded.  To determine if any state really overperforms or underperforms in producing the highest level ballplayers, the difference between these two percentages was found, and both the top and bottom 5 were again plotted.\n",

    "The findings paint a much different picture than the first figure.  California again leads the way by a long shot, and the data points to the state being the premiere place for producing MLB All-Stars.  On the other hand, Texas and Florida were previously thought to be top producers, but the chart suggests that their production lags behind what would be expected from civilian populations of their size.  In all, it seems that pure population size of a state drives higher numbers of MLB All-Stars, but the theory of warmer climates being more efficient does not seem to be explicitly supported, evidenced by the performance of Texas, Arizona, and Florida.

    "The next attribute is inspired by recent public research on NHL players.  A study publish by PLOS ONE in 2013 stated that hockey players born in the first quarter of the year made up 36% of all players drafted in the NHL from 1980 to 2007.  The reasoning for the uneven proportion in the early months was cutoffs for select hockey teams occured at that time, making these players the oldest on the teams.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The birth months of American born All-Stars are plotted below, and it seems the opposite is the case.  The first quarter appears to be a below the rest of the year.  The mode, August, is very important here.  The most MLB All-Stars have been born in that month, and there are a few possible explanations.  For one, July 31 has served for decades as the cutoff date for most recreational baseball leagues in America.  This means August born players would be the oldest on the teams.  Also, this coincides with the beginning dates of the school year for many public schools in America.  Unless a child is started early, kids born in August again will most likely be among the oldest in the grade.  Age translates to physical maturity and time to hone skills, so these kids will have an inherit edge in their younger years and more incentive to continue their careers in baseball having seen success."

However, not every aspiring player reaches the pinnacle of the sport, for it's a game of numbers and the majority of signees will stall out in the minors or enjoy a short-lived major league career.  Therefore, the study will conclude with a review of debut ages for All-Stars to help determine whether a minor league player might still be on the path to greatness or fading past their window of opportunity."

    "The mean debut age of MLB All-Stars is 22.93, with a first quartile of 21.5 and third quartile 24.2.  This seems fairly young, but most of top prosepects don't spend a long time in the minor leagues.  The data seems to suggest that Major League teams quickly identify these top prospects and feel they can be an asset to their club at an early age, thus resulting in the young average debut age.  "

This was something that seemed curious in the descriptive statistics previously stated, especially with a minimum age of 15 years old and maximum of 42.  To take a closer look at what these outliers might represent and confirm the validity of the dataset, we'll search for where these maximums and minimums occur."

    "The player corresponding to the maximum age of MLB debut for an eventual All-Star is Satchel Paige.  Paige actually made his professional baseball debut in 1926, but this came in the Negro Leagues as baseball at the time was segregated.  He was arguably the greatest pitcher ever to play the game, so it's not a surprise that when he finally was allowed to play in Major League Baseball in 1948 he still had enough left in the tank to earn All-Star status."

Joe Nuxhall was called upon to pitch for the Reds for one game in 1944 because of player shortages associated with World War II.  He eventually made it back to the big leagues in 1952 and made an All-Star team 3 years later.\n",

    "The above histogram is fairly normally distributed and as expected the visual confirms ages 21 to 23 to be the most common.  Since a debut age of 24 still has seen over 200 players go on to be All-Stars, it seems logical to use this age as a rough cutoff.  Age 25 has less than 100 All-Stars, and the frequency just decreases from there as ages increases.  Therefore, it's consistent with the data to have a marker around age 25 as the shrinking point for the window of opportunity of minor league players to become All-Star caliber.  In other words, it would be around this age where the likelihood of becoming an All-Star for a player yet to play in the Majors decreases substantially."

    "It takes a lot of hard work, determination, and a little bit of luck along the journey to rise to stardom in Major League Baseball.  Every player in the study possessed something special that separated them from the rest of the pack and allowed them to become one of the game's finest.  In the end, the study suggests that top level hitters make more yearly than pitchers, and left handed hitting, left handed throwing position players are the highest paid commodity.  A majority of All-Stars in the modern era come from the collegiate ranks, though All-Star pitchers are more likely to attend than hitters.  After accounting for population differences, no region or climate particularly seemed to be a more fertile breeding ground for All-Star level talent.  However, the state of California produces the most and does it at a higher rate than one might expect from their population.  The month of August was the most common month of birth for All-Stars, and the second half of the calendar outweighed the first six months.  Finally, the majority of players of All-Stars have made their debut in the Majors by age 25.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the findings are tenative and based on some assumptions within the given data.  Every player is not born with the same athleticism or skillset, so assuming each player has the same chance to reach the elite level is shortsighted.  Also of note is that society and population tendencies have changed over time.  A great example of this is the maximum and minimum debut age research, where external factors that the player had no control over had a huge impact on the course of their careers.  Likewise, the game of baseball has tranformed many times throughout history from the Dead Ball era to the Steroid era to the modern day game.  The inferences drawn throughout the study are from the totality of this time frame and should be treated with caution as such.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward, there are future studies into this same data that could attempt to explain or help prove some of the assumptions drawn.  In particular, it would be interesting to dive into the position break down and the hypotheses that were made about first baseman and outfielders being the most offensive minded on the field.  Along these lines, true correlations between lefty hitters throwing left handed and vice versa for righties would be enlightening, for it was assumed that by nature the majority of players were like this.  It would also be informative to research the longevity in the game of position players and pitchers.  The assumptions about injury rates for pitchers and their ability to stay on the field to get to more lucrative deals would be very pertinent topics to further investigate.  Finally, the data was sorted to exclude all players born outside the United States, and foreign born plays certainly play a significant role in the landscape of professional baseball today."
